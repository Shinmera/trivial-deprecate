# About Trivial-Deprecate
This library implements a simple deprecation mechanism, and hooks into implementation-provided facilities when possible. The main entry point is ``declaim-deprecated`` to mark a definition as deprecated:

:: common lisp
(trivial-deprecate:declaim-deprecated (function my-foo)
  :alternatives (my-foo2))
::

The interface is portable to all implementations, though use-warnings may not be issued for all definitions on all implementations.
